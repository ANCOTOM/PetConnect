# PetConnect Project Explanation

## Overview
PetConnect is a social networking application designed specifically for pet lovers. It allows users to connect, share updates about their pets, and interact with a community of like-minded individuals. The application is built using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend services (Authentication and Database).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React (Vite)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** Radix UI (via shadcn/ui)
- **Backend/BaaS:** Firebase
  - **Authentication:** Firebase Auth (Email/Password, OAuth providers)
  - **Database:** Cloud Firestore (NoSQL database)
- **Icons:** Lucide React

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard React application structure:

- `src/`
  - `App.jsx`: The main entry point and container for the application.
  - `main.jsx`: Bootstraps the React application.
  - `firebase/`: Contains Firebase configuration and initialization.
  - `components/`: Contains all the React components used in the application.
    - `ui/`: Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) based on shadcn/ui.
  - `styles/`: Global styles and Tailwind configuration.

## Key Components and Interactions

### 1. App.jsx (Main Container)
- **Role:** Acts as the central state manager and router for the application.
- **State Management:**
  - Manages the current authenticated user (`user`, `profile`).
  - Controls the current view being displayed (Feed, Profile, Notifications, Settings, Admin).
  - Fetches and manages the main feed of posts.
- **Interactions:**
  - Listens for Firebase Auth state changes to handle user sessions.
  - Passes user data and navigation handlers down to child components.

### 2. AuthForm.jsx (Authentication)
- **Role:** Handles user registration and login.
- **Features:**
  - Supports Email/Password sign-up and sign-in.
  - Integrates with OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub).
  - Handles password reset functionality.
- **Data Flow:**
  - On successful registration, it creates a new document in the `users` Firestore collection with user details (name, pet name, pet type).

### 3. CreatePostForm.jsx (Content Creation)
- **Role:** Allows authenticated users to create new posts.
- **Features:**
  - Text input for post content.
  - Support for Image and Video URLs.
  - Visibility settings (Public/Private).
- **Data Flow:**
  - Writes a new document to the `posts` collection in Firestore.
  - Includes metadata like `userId`, `authorName`, and `createdAt`.

### 4. PostCard.jsx (Post Display)
- **Role:** Renders an individual post and manages user interactions with it.
- **Features:**
  - Displays post content (text, media).
  - Like functionality (toggles like status).
  - Share functionality.
  - Edit and Delete options for the post owner.
  - Report functionality for inappropriate content.
- **Data Flow:**
  - Updates the `posts` document in Firestore (e.g., incrementing counters).
  - Manages sub-collections for `likes` and `shares` within the post document to track user interactions.

### 5. ProfileView.jsx (User Profile)
- **Role:** Displays user information and their specific posts.
- **Interactions:**
  - Fetches user details from the `users` collection.
  - Queries the `posts` collection for posts authored by the specific user.

## Data Flow & State Management
- **Global State:** `App.jsx` holds the "source of truth" for the user's session and the main feed data.
- **Local State:** Individual components manage their own UI state (e.g., form inputs, loading states, toggle states).
- **Backend Sync:** The application relies heavily on direct Firestore queries and real-time updates (where applicable) to keep the UI in sync with the backend data.

## Database Schema (Inferred)
- **users/**: Stores user profiles.
- **posts/**: Stores all posts.
  - **likes/** (Sub-collection): Tracks who liked the post.
  - **shares/** (Sub-collection): Tracks who shared the post.
- **reports/**: Stores reports filed against posts.
